V 3.1

This version of ART nouveau implements FIRE for perpendicular minimization
during the activation (by Laurent Karim Béland, Oak Ridge National Lab). 

It also incorporates a number of corrections and bug fixing by
Jean-François Joly (Carleton University), who revised, among other things,
the implementation of Fire.
